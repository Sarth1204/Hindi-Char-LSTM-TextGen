This project focuses on building a character-level text generation model using an LSTM neural network. The primary goal is to predict the next character in a sequence, which can be particularly useful for generating text in the Hindi language or other similar scripts. 

The workflow involves tokenizing text at the character level, preparing sequences of fixed lengths, and training an LSTM-based model to learn language patterns. The model is designed to handle a custom vocabulary, and it uses embedding layers to represent characters numerically.

Key features include:
- Character-level tokenization using TensorFlow's Tokenizer.
- Sequential data preparation for training the LSTM model.
- Prediction of the next character based on a sequence of previous characters.
- A softmax-based output layer for multi-class classification over the vocabulary.

This repository is ideal for researchers and developers working on text generation, language modeling, or character-level sequence prediction, especially for languages with complex scripts like Hindi.
